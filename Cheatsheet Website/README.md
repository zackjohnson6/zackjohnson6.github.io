# Lesson 12 Final Exam Project - Part 2
This is the Final Exam Project for CIS233DA. The project will require you to build a multi-page website. In part 2, you will be creating the website using your knowledge of HTML, CSS, accessibility, and best practices learned throughout the course.

## Project Prep
1. If necessary, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there.
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.

## Project Directions
Complete the final exam by creating the necessary HTML files, CSS files, images, and other assets to build your website based upon the project plan you developed in Part 1 of the Final Exam project.

## Submit the Project

1. Make sure that you have validated your HTML and CSS code. 
   1. If any errors were found within the validators, be sure to fix those errors before you submit your assignment.

3. Push (i.e., sync) the repo on your computer with GitHub to ensure all files are uploaded for your instructor to see.
4. Publish your site using GitHub Pages.
